title: The Evangelist's Reading List
***

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/rehost%2F2016%2F9%2F13%2F9b64218a-939c-485d-89c6-ae247784ddc3.jpg" /></div>

Tech evangelism or developer advocacy or whatever you choose to call it is booming. A quick search on LinkedIn for three of the most popular titles for what we do (technical evangelist, developer advocate, developer relations) returned more than 12,000 people and around 300 job openings. Because this profession is still new and evolving the education process remains largely self-driven. 

Luckily, we have the Evangelism Collective - a group of technical evangelists, developer advocates, and other community builders. The core of the community is a Slack channel that is a mix of equal parts camaraderie, mentorship, and shared suffering. It is a vibrant community and a great place to learn about what is happening in the field. 

I recently posted a request for book recomemendations. Not surprisingly, the community was quick to respond. Because it is a free community, at some point, the older parts of our history will be replaced by a recent message. So in order to preserve the knowledge of the group, I wanted to quickly jot down this community-sourced evangelism reading list (along with a few of my own picks).

If you are not a tech evangelist, you may still find some interesting recommendations in this list of titles. I was certainly surprised by the range of responses. Take a look:
