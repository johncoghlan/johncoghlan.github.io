title: Welcome to the new blog!

Hi, I'm John. I have two passions in life: surfing and helping people love their work. Since the surfing thing was going nowhere, I work on People Operations and Tech Evangelism at HBC Digital. 

I created this blog, replacing my old blog at [coghlan.me](http://coghlan.me), so I could familiarize myself with Jekyll which is what we use for the [Gilt Tech blog](http://tech.gilt.com). Stay tuned for posts on people ops, culture, community and evangelism in tech.  

I'll leave you with some trivia: what bridge are we standing under?
